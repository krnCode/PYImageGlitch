# Image Glitcher

## Description

This is a small python script that glitches all images from a desired folder, and save them in a specified folder.

Just like [my other script that applied filters to all images in a folder and saved them in another folder](https://github.com/kornflakes/PYImageModifier), but this time is the glitch effect!

This was made possible because of the awesome **glitch-this** module! You can check more information about this module [right here.](https://github.com/TotallyNotChase/glitch-this)

## Notes

So first what you'll need to do is to define the folders in the script. The folder that contains the images that you want to glitch, and the folder that you'll want to save them.

This time you can also choose the intensity of the glitch! The effect work with floats, that goes from 0.0 (no effect) to 10.0, inclusive (so much effect that it looks like another image!).

I recommended that you check out the [documentation of the glitch-this module](https://github.com/TotallyNotChase/glitch-this/wiki/Documentation:-The-commandline-script) so you can understand how it works.
